1. Create an empty array called `students`.
2. Write a function called `addStudent` that has one argument, an object. The function, when executed, will add the object to the end of the array.
3. Create five objects to represent students with the following information: name (string), subject (string) and score(number).
4. Call the function `addStudent` to add each student object to the array `students`.
5. Write a for loop to iterate over the array and console log the string `[Student name] has a score of [score] in [subject].` for each student.
6. Find the average score among all the students and write it to the console.
7. Modify the for loop so that students only the students with a score greater than or equal to 70 are displayed in the console.
